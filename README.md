## Why You Should Care

>Zeek is is a network security monitoring tool that can analyze and log network traffic. To tool can both greatly expedite tactical analysis and can be scaled and leveraged to provide proactive monitoring for an organization. Zeek supports a range of extensibility options and provides frameworks for many forms of advanced network analysis capabilities.


## Three Main Ideas
- Zeek parses both captured and live network traffic and provides enriched output through packet, protocol, and file analyzers.
- Zeek has a significant range of log outputs that can be leveraged for numerous analytic purposes.
- Zeek provides several extensibility options through a package manager, integration frameworks, plugins, and several scripting interface options.


## Future Direction

>The topics introduced are meant to survey the capabilities and frameworks that exist with the Zeek tool. Any of the concepts presented could be expanded on by providing a more in-depth review or detail on how to optimize it for a specific analysis environment. Some sample recommendations would be to provide a detailed review of the parser functions and analyzers or to review a sample Spicy scripting implementation.
